/*
As a Javascript developer, provide me a very simple skeleton framework to start building an Android app that leverages off the ChatGPT API.

Here is a very simple skeleton framework for building an Android app that leverages the ChatGPT API:

1. Create a new Android project in Android Studio. 
2. Add the ChatGPT SDK as a dependency in your project. 
3. Create an instance of the ChatGPT class.
4. Set up the ChatGPT listener to receive responses from the ChatGPT API.
5. Create a UI for the app, including an input box for the user to type in their query and a list to display the response from the ChatGPT API.
6. Connect the UI to the ChatGPT instance by sending the user query to the ChatGPT instance and displaying the response in the list.
7. Implement additional features and customizations as needed.

export const handler = async (event: Record<string, any>) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(
      {
        message: 'Go Serverless v3.0! Your function executed successfully!',
        input: event,
      },
      null,
      2,
    ),
  };
};
